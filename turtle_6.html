        <p>
            As a fond mother, when the day is o'er,</br>
            Leads by the hand her little child to bed,</br>
            Half willing, half reluctant to be led,</br>
            And leave his broken playthings on the floor,</br>
         Still gazing at them through the open door,</br>
            Nor wholly reassured and comforted</br>
            By promises of others in their stead,</br>
            Which, though more splendid, may not please him more;</br>
         So Nature deals with us, and takes away</br>
            Our playthings one by one, and by the hand</br>
            Leads us to rest so gently, that we go</br>
         Scarce knowing if we wish to go or stay,</br>
            Being too full of sleep to understand</br>
            How far the unknown transcends the what we know.</br>
