        <p>
            A Bird, came down the Walk - </br>
            He did not know I saw - </br>
            He bit an Angle Worm in halves </br>
            And ate the fellow, raw, </br>
        </br>
            And then, he drank a Dew </br>
            From a convenient Grass - </br>
            And then hopped sidewise to the Wall </br>
            To let a Beetle pass - </br>
        </br>
            He glanced with rapid eyes, </br>
            That hurried all abroad - </br>
            They looked like frightened Beads, I thought, </br>
            He stirred his Velvet Head. - </br>
        </br>
            Like one in danger, Cautious, </br>
            I offered him a Crumb, </br>
            And he unrolled his feathers, </br>
            And rowed him softer Home - </br>
        </br>
            Than Oars divide the Ocean, </br>
            Too silver for a seam, </br>
            Or Butterflies, off Banks of Noon, </br>
            Leap, plashless as they swim. </br>
        </p>
