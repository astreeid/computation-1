    <div class="main">
        <p>
            How vainly men themselves amaze </br>
            To win the palm, the oak, or bays,</br>
            And their uncessant labours see</br>
            Crown’d from some single herb or tree,</br>
            Whose short and narrow verged shade</br>
            Does prudently their toils upbraid;</br>
            While all flow’rs and all trees do close</br>
            To weave the garlands of repose.</br>
        </br>
            Fair Quiet, have I found thee here,</br>
            And Innocence, thy sister dear!</br>
            Mistaken long, I sought you then</br>
            In busy companies of men;</br>
            Your sacred plants, if here below,</br>
            Only among the plants will grow.</br>
            Society is all but rude,</br>
            To this delicious solitude.</br>
        </br>
            No white nor red was ever seen</br>
            So am’rous as this lovely green.</br>
            Fond lovers, cruel as their flame,</br>
            Cut in these trees their mistress’ name;</br>
            Little, alas, they know or heed</br>
            How far these beauties hers exceed!</br>
            Fair trees! wheres’e’er your barks I wound,</br>
            No name shall but your own be found.</br>
        </br>
            When we have run our passion’s heat,</br>
            Love hither makes his best retreat.</br>
            The gods, that mortal beauty chase,</br>
            Still in a tree did end their race:</br>
            Apollo hunted Daphne so,</br>
            Only that she might laurel grow;</br>
            And Pan did after Syrinx speed,</br>
            Not as a nymph, but for a reed.</br>
        </br>
            What wond’rous life in this I lead!</br>
            Ripe apples drop about my head;</br>
            The luscious clusters of the vine</br>
            Upon my mouth do crush their wine;</br>
            The nectarine and curious peach</br>
            Into my hands themselves do reach;</br>
            Stumbling on melons as I pass,</br>
            Ensnar’d with flow’rs, I fall on grass.</br>
        </br>
            Meanwhile the mind, from pleasure less,</br>
            Withdraws into its happiness;</br>
            The mind, that ocean where each kind</br>
            Does straight its own resemblance find,</br>
            Yet it creates, transcending these,</br>
            Far other worlds, and other seas;</br>
            Annihilating all that’s made</br>
            To a green thought in a green shade.</br>
        </br>
            Here at the fountain’s sliding foot,</br>
            Or at some fruit tree’s mossy root,</br>
            Casting the body’s vest aside,</br>
            My soul into the boughs does glide;</br>
            There like a bird it sits and sings,</br>
            Then whets, and combs its silver wings;</br>
            And, till prepar’d for longer flight,
            Waves in its plumes the various light.</br>
        </br>
            Such was that happy garden-state,</br>
            While man there walk’d without a mate;</br>
            After a place so pure and sweet,</br>
            What other help could yet be meet!</br>
            But ’twas beyond a mortal’s share</br>
            To wander solitary there:</br>
            Two paradises ’twere in one</br>
            To live in paradise alone.</br>
        </br>
            How well the skillful gard’ner drew</br>
            Of flow’rs and herbs this dial new,</br>
            Where from above the milder sun</br>
            Does through a fragrant zodiac run;</br>
            And as it works, th’ industrious bee</br>
            Computes its time as well as we.</br>
            How could such sweet and wholesome hours</br>
            Be reckon’d but with herbs and flow’rs!</br>
            
        </p>
