    <div class="header">I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud</div>
    <div class="main">
        <p>
            I wandered lonely as a cloud </br>
            That floats on high o'er vales and hills,</br>
            When all at once I saw a crowd,</br>
            A host, of golden daffodils;</br>
            Beside the lake, beneath the trees,</br>
            Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.</br>
        </br>
            Continuous as the stars that shine</br>
            And twinkle on the milky way,</br>
            They stretched in never-ending line</br>
            Along the margin of a bay:</br>
            Ten thousand saw I at a glance,</br>
            Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.</br>
        </br>
            The waves beside them danced; but they</br>
            Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:</br>
            A poet could not but be gay,</br>
            In such a jocund company:</br>
            I gazed—and gazed—but little thought</br>
            What wealth the show to me had brought:</br>
        </br>
            For oft, when on my couch I lie</br>
            In vacant or in pensive mood,</br>
            They flash upon that inward eye</br>
            Which is the bliss of solitude;</br>
            And then my heart with pleasure fills,</br>
            And dances with the daffodils.</br>
            
        </p>
