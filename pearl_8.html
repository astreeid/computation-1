    <div class="header">On a Drop of Dew</div>
    <div class="main">
        <p>
            See how the orient dew,</br>
            Shed from the bosom of the morn</br>
               Into the blowing roses,</br>
            Yet careless of its mansion new,</br>
            For the clear region where ’twas born</br>
               Round in itself incloses:</br>
               And in its little globe’s extent,</br>
            Frames as it can its native element.</br>
               How it the purple flow’r does slight, </br>
                  Scarce touching where it lies,</br>
               But gazing back upon the skies,   </br>
                  Shines with a mournful light,</br>
                     Like its own tear,</br>
            Because so long divided from the sphere.</br>
               Restless it rolls and unsecure,</br>
                  Trembling lest it grow impure,</br>
               Till the warm sun pity its pain,   </br>
            And to the skies exhale it back again.</br>
                  So the soul, that drop, that ray   </br>
            Of the clear fountain of eternal day,   </br>
            Could it within the human flow’r be seen,</br>
                  Remembering still its former height,</br>
                  Shuns the sweet leaves and blossoms green,</br>
                  And recollecting its own light,</br>
            Does, in its pure and circling thoughts, express</br>
            The greater heaven in an heaven less.   </br>
                  In how coy a figure wound,   </br>
                  Every way it turns away:   </br>
                  So the world excluding round,   </br>
                  Yet receiving in the day,</br>
                  Dark beneath, but bright above,</br>
                  Here disdaining, there in love.</br>
               How loose and easy hence to go,</br>
               How girt and ready to ascend,</br>
               Moving but on a point below,</br>
               It all about does upwards bend.</br>
            Such did the manna’s sacred dew distill,   </br>
            White and entire, though congealed and chill,   </br>
            Congealed on earth : but does, dissolving, run   </br>
            Into the glories of th’ almighty sun.</br>
        </p>
