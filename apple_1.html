    <div class="main">
        <p>
            The world is too much with us; late and soon, </br>
            Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers;— </br>
            Little we see in Nature that is ours; </br>
            We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon! </br>
            This Sea that bares her bosom to the moon; </br>
            The winds that will be howling at all hours, </br>
            And are up-gathered now like sleeping flowers; </br>
            For this, for everything, we are out of tune; </br>
            It moves us not. Great God! I’d rather be </br>
            A Pagan suckled in a creed outworn; </br>
            So might I, standing on this pleasant lea, </br>
            Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn; </br>
            Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea; </br>
            Or hear old Triton blow his wreathèd horn. </br>
        </p>
