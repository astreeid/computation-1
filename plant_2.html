    <div class="main">
        <p>
            How fresh, oh Lord, how sweet and clean </br>
            Are thy returns! even as the flowers in spring; </br>
                     To which, besides their own demean,</br>
            The late-past frosts tributes of pleasure bring.</br>
                                  Grief melts away</br>
                                  Like snow in May,</br>
                     As if there were no such cold thing.</br>
                    </br>
                     Who would have thought my shriveled heart</br>
            Could have recovered greenness? It was gone</br>
                     Quite underground; as flowers depart</br>
            To see their mother-root, when they have blown,</br>
                                  Where they together</br>
                                  All the hard weather,</br>
                     Dead to the world, keep house unknown.</br>
                    </br>
                     These are thy wonders, Lord of power,</br>
            Killing and quickening, bringing down to hell</br>
                     And up to heaven in an hour;</br>
            Making a chiming of a passing-bell.</br>
                                  We say amiss</br>
                                  This or that is:</br>
                     Thy word is all, if we could spell.</br>
                    </br>
                     Oh that I once past changing were,</br>
            Fast in thy Paradise, where no flower can wither!</br>
                     Many a spring I shoot up fair,</br>
            Offering at heaven, growing and groaning thither;</br>
                                  Nor doth my flower</br>
                                  Want a spring shower,</br>
                     My sins and I joining together.</br>
                    </br>
                     But while I grow in a straight line,</br>
            Still upwards bent, as if heaven were mine own,</br>
                     Thy anger comes, and I decline:</br>
            What frost to that? what pole is not the zone</br>
                                  Where all things burn,</br>
                                  When thou dost turn,</br>
                     And the least frown of thine is shown?</br>
                    </br>
                     And now in age I bud again,</br>
            After so many deaths I live and write;</br>
                     I once more smell the dew and rain,</br>
            And relish versing. Oh, my only light,</br>
                                  It cannot be</br>
                                  That I am he</br>
                     On whom thy tempests fell all night.</br>
                    </br>
                     These are thy wonders, Lord of love,</br>
            To make us see we are but flowers that glide;</br>
                     Which when we once can find and prove,</br>
            Thou hast a garden for us where to bide;</br>
                                  Who would be more,</br>
                                  Swelling through store,</br>
                     Forfeit their Paradise by their pride.</br>
        </p>
